## Data

The data.zip file comprises the parent folder, <i>data</i>, under which there exist three separate folders each denoting a separate experiment, namely <i>DnB1, DnB1+DnB2, DnB2</i>. 

Each of these folders consist of 5 sub-folders denoting the number of chunks used in the experiments. In each sub-folder, there exists the train and test folders for training and testing our models, respectively.

## Code

The file requires a target.xlsx file to run. However, we do not provide the file due to privacy concerns.
